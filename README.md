# Python Workload planning project 

The goal of this project to learn haow to connect to a database, how to read, update and write it, how to show the data from the database.

It is also a goal to learn to write good prompt for AI to generate codes a shorter time, than I write it.

This could be a good timecapsule for me to track my learning process.
